								Polyester Partially Oriented Yarn (POY) is produced from the melting and extrusion of the polyester chip or flake, made directly from PTA and MEG by using spinning and take-up process
								and mainly used in texturizing to make textured yarn (DTY). During the spinning process the filaments are stretched or drawn up to five times of their original size to orient the polymer
								to meet the desired evenness, strength, shrinkage, and elongation properties. Therefore, the term partially oriented yarn refers to multi-filament that is only partially stretched. POY is
								generally lower tenacity and less uniform than fully oriented yarn (FOY). Additional, POY can also be used in draw warping for weaving and warp knitting of fabrics.

									master-batch is mixed with the raw material to
									make the dope dyed POY. Dope dyed POY yarn

								There are 2 ways to recycle polyester. Firstly, for mechanical recycling, plastic is melted to make new yarn. This process can be done a few times before the fiber loses its quality.
								Secondly, chemical recycling involves breaking down the plastic molecules and reforming them into yarn. This process maintains the quality of the original fiber and allows the material
								to be recycled infinitely, but it is more expensive than the first process.
