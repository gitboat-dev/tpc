                                Polyester Partially Oriented Yarn (POY) is produced from the melting and extrusion of the
                                polyester chip or flake, made directly from PTA and MEG by using spinning and take-up
                                process and used primarily in texturizing to make textured yarn (DTY). The filaments are
                                stretched or drawn up to five times their original size during the spinning process to orient
                                the polymer to meet the desired evenness, strength, shrinkage, and elongation properties.
                                Therefore, the term partially oriented yarn refers to multi-filament that is only partially
                                stretched. As a result, POY is generally had lower tenacity and less uniform than fully
                                oriented yarn (FOY). Additionally, POY can also use in draw warping for weaving and warp
                                knitted fabrics.

                                    The bright POY has shininess due to the filaments' cross-sections. The fabric is made from
                                    bright POY also has a bright luster.

                                    Polyester POY is mainly available in raw white color and various colors. The Dope-Dyed
                                    technology has much more efficient when colors on POY and the yarn gets evenly colored at
                                    every part. Color master-batch is mixed with the raw material to make the dope-dyed POY.
                                    Dope-dyed POY can be used to make the Dope Dyed DTY yarn.

                                Recycled Polyester Partially Oriented Yarn is made
                                from R-Pet and recycled plastic bottles. It is such a great way
                                to divert plastic waste from landfills. In addition,
                                the production of recycled polyester requires fewer resources
                                than new fibers and generates fewer CO2 emissions.

                                There are 2 ways to recycle polyester. Firstly, for mechanical recycling, plastic is melted to
                                make new yarns. This process can be done a few times before the fiber loses its quality.
                                Secondly, chemical recycling involves breaking down the plastic molecules and reforming
                                them into yarn. This process maintains the quality of the original fiber and allows the
                                material to be recycled infinitely, but it is more expensive than the first process.
