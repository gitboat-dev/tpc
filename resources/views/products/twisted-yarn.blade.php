								Twisting is simply the process of combining
								together multiple fibers, threads or yarns in a
								wrapping around (twisting) motion. Twisting
								fibers will create a thread (or singles), twisting
								threads will create a yarn, and twisting yarns will
								create a cord or cable - and so on.

								The twisting process is when one end of a fiber
								strand is held and the other end is turned back to
								form a yarn.
							</p>
							<p class="p2">
								For staple fibers, twisting is necessary to turn the
								fibers into a yarn. Before twisting, the loose fibers
								are usually coalesced into a fiber strip, and after
								twisting the outer fibers are squeezed towards
								the inner layers to create centripetal pressure,
								which causes the strand to gain friction along the
								direction of the fiber elongation.

								For filament yarn and ply yarn, twisting creates a
								compact structure that is not easily damaged by
								lateral external forces, and twisting also creates
								deformed filaments and fancy threads. The
								amount and direction of twisting affects not only
								the feel and appearance of the fabric but also its
								intrinsic quality.
							</p>
							<p class="p2">
								After twisting, the outer fiber is twisted back in
								an inclined spiral, the fiber is twisted and
								deformed and the yarns are held together,
								changing the collective structural form and
								mechanical and physical properties of the fibers.

								In the other word, the portion of the fiber on the yarns indicates where the yarn is S or Z twist. Regular weaving industry usually used a Z twisted yarn.
								The direction of the twisted may observe by holding the yarns in a vertical position. If the twisted direction of the slope of the center part of the letter “S”, the yarn has an S twist.
								If the yarn spiral conforms to the slope of the letter “Z”, the yarn has a ‘Z” twist.

								The twisted affects the strength, flexibility, elasticity
								and shrinkage of the yarn. If the twisted
								increases, the strength of the yarn would be
								increased, but the twist must not exceed a certain
								value, otherwise the strength decreases, which is
								called the critical twist of the yarn. The critical
								twisted is different for yarns made from different
								raw materials. In general, as long as the strength
								requirements are met, the less twist the yarn has,
								the better, because an increasing in the twisted
								makes the yarn stiffer to the touch, less elastic
								and more shrinkage, this is the reason why filament
								yarns are twisted as little as possible.

								The amount of twisted can be measure by the
