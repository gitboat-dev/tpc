                                Polyester Staple Fiber (PSF) is a synthetic man-made fiber created directly via a polymerization process of polyester
                                material such as PTA (Purified Terephthalic Acid) and MEG (Mono Ethylene Glycol) under high temperature and
                                pressure. After the spinning and drawing process, the polymer becomes staple fibers and is cut to a specific cut length.
                                Polyester staple fiber plays an essential role in the textile industry due to several advantages of its characteristics.
                                Polyester staple fiber is more durable than cotton or wool. Additionally, polyester staple fiber also has high heat,
                                wrinkle and abrasion resistance, low absorbency, a stretching and shrinking resistance and quick-dry after washing.

                                How is polyester staple fiber made?
                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                Polyester Staple Fiber is a synthetic man-made fiber made directly from Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA) and Mono Ethylene Glycol (MEG) or Polyethylene
                                Terephthalate (PET Chips), while recycled polyester staple fiber is made from recycled PET Chips, polyester waste, or post-consumer PET bottle flakes.
                                The production of polyester staple fiber starts from the polymerization process where PTA is fed into hot MEG under a high temperature and pressure setting.
                                Next is the melt spinning process. The bundle of continuous filaments obtained from the melt spinning technique (called tow) is subjected to the application
                                of more processes such as drawing and crimping and is then cut into fixed lengths. After the cutting process, these cut fibers are called polyester staple fibers.

                                used in spinning production as a raw material for Polyester spun yarn,
                                further knitted or woven into fabrics. Additionally, polyester staple fiber

                            <p>
                                Polyester staple fiber is mainly used in spinning production in the textile industry. Wherein, the resulting yarns, spun yarns, are used for apparel manufacturing,
                                including sportswear, activewear, and intimate wear. As well as, shirts, socks, dresses, lingerie, gloves, suits, and sewing threads etc. In spinning production, polyester staple
                                fiber can be individually produced for 100% Polyester spun yarn or combined with cotton, viscose or wool for blended yarn such as CVC 70/30 consisting of 70% cotton fiber
                                and 30% polyester staple fiber. Compared to the cotton fiber, polyester staple fiber has major benefits in terms of cost, thinness, strength, abrasion resistance, water
                                absorption, and multiple designs and colors. Thus, polyester staple fiber can be considered the main cotton fiber alternative for the garment industry.
