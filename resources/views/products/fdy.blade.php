                                Additionally, Fully Drawn Yarn (FDY) is suitable for twisting in warp and weave. Most manufacturers
                                use twisted FDY to make polyester embroidery thread, and it is mostly used in sewing. Furthermore,
                                Fully Drawn Yarn (FDY) can be made in 2 lusters, including Semi-dull (SD) and Trilobal Bright (TBR).
                                FDY yarn of trilobal bright luster is generally used in making curtains, bedsheets, and carpets. Apart
                                from the above 3 lusters, FDY is also available in raw white and dope dyed. FDY Dope-Dyed can
                                usually be utilized to make the colored fabric directly instead of initially creating the fabric with FDY
                                raw white and then dyeing it.
