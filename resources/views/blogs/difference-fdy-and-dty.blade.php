                                FDY is also known as Polyester Filament Yarn (PFY) or Spin Draw Yarn (SDY).
                                FDY manufacturing process is similar to the POY manufacturing process. But
                                FDY is produced at higher speeds than the POY manufacturing process, and
                                intermediate drawing integrated into stretching, orientation and crystallization
                                is more stable. This yarn is used for direct twisting, multiplies yarns, beaming,
                                and direct knitting. And FDY threads are mostly used to make non-textured
                                fabrics such as hospital clothes, pads, surgical sets, wound healing, wet tissues,
                                sanitary napkins, baby diapers, coatings, insulating, flooring, carpeting, etc.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                FDY is mainly used as weft or weaves in producing fabrics. But it also can
                                combine knitted or woven in various filaments to get various styles.

                                    FDY application has a wide range. It is a type of highly drawn filament yarn that can be used to produce high-strength fabrics and textiles and in a home furnishing fabrics, fashion fabrics,
                                    Denim, Terry towel, etc. Sometimes, it is also used to produce high-end undergarments, sportswear, home furnishings and non-textured fabrics.

                                    FDY thread is used in different types of shrinkage and areas of the textile industry. For example, FDY threads with a high shrinkage are used in fabricating cloth and curtain fabrics and create a
                                    blooming structure on the fabric surface. On the other hand, FDY threads with a low shrinkage are widely used in the blanket industry.

                                    DTY manufacturing process is produced by simultaneously twisting and
                                    drawing by a high-pitched POY texturing machine. It is a continuous
                                    filament yarn that contains permanent distortions, crimps, loops, coils or
                                    crinkles on DTY. This process disperses, curls, and entangles the filaments
                                    composing the POY yarn, giving DTY a fluffy appearance and the properties
                                    of both natural and synthetic fiber. DTY yarns are known as thread, Heat set,
                                    and bulky filament. They still give soft and woolly feel properties because
                                    they increase the warmth and comfort texturing into yarn.

                                    DTY is mainly used in weaving and knitting, such as making clothes, home
                                    furnishing, seat covers, bags, etc.

                                    With its properties of soft crimp, high bulk, high durability and retention,
                                    DTY is also suitable in making outer/inner garments, skin-clinging garments,
                                    furnishings, upholstery, etc., which are a replacement for cotton.

                                    The technical properties of DTY can be molded into several ways to make the
                                    yarn suitable for its vast uses. In addition, different heating techniques can
                                    be made for the yarn set in specific use.<br>
                                    1 Heater DTY is normally woolly & more stretchable as compared to DTY with<br>
                                    2 Heater.

                                    Also, the DTY can be made with several combinations of Intermingle points –
                                    it can be Non-Intermingle (NIM) or Semi-Intermingle (SIM) or High-Intermingle
                                    (HIM). The knots are not the knots tied when two threads are broken
                                    but they are the tangle knots created by heating pressure. These Intermingle
                                    yarns, also known as Interlaced yarn, are the replacement for lightly twisted
                                    yarns. DTY yarn can also be twisted to high twists like 1500 TPM or 4000 TPM
                                    (twist per meter). Such twisted yarn can also be heat-set to make the yarn
                                    permanently thermo-set the twist.

                                    - FDY has high strength than DTY because it is fully drawn yarn.<br>
                                    - FDY cannot stretch much as DTY. Some products don’t need a stretch. FDY
                                    is more suitable than DTY.<br>
                                    - DTY is softer than FDY because it has a soft crimp texture. The texture will
                                    give a soft hand feel. It is usually produced in upholstery or skin-clinging
                                    garment.<br>
                                    - DTY has more stretch because texture also gives flexibility as it brings the
