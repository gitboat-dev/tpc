                                FDY is also known as Polyester Filament Yarn (PFY) or Spin Draw Yarn (SDY).
                                FDY manufacturing process is similar to the POY manufacturing process. But
                                FDY is produced at higher speeds than the POY manufacturing process, and
                                intermediate drawing integrated into stretching, orientation and crystallization
                                is more stable. This yarn is used for direct twisting, multiplies yarns, beaming,
                                and direct knitting. And FDY threads are mostly used to make non-textured
                                fabrics such as hospital clothes, pads, surgical sets, wound healing, wet tissues,
                                sanitary napkins, baby diapers, coatings, insulating, flooring, carpeting, etc.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                FDY is mainly used as weft or weaves in producing fabrics. But it also can
                                combine knitted or woven in various filaments to get various styles.

                                    FDY application has a wide range. It is a type of highly drawn filament yarn that can be used to produce high-strength fabrics and textiles and in a home furnishing fabrics, fashion fabrics,
                                    Denim, Terry towel, etc. Sometimes, it is also used to produce high-end undergarments, sportswear, home furnishings and non-textured fabrics.

                                    FDY thread is used in different types of shrinkage and areas of the textile industry. For example, FDY threads with a high shrinkage are used in fabricating cloth and curtain fabrics and create a
                                    blooming structure on the fabric surface. On the other hand, FDY threads with a low shrinkage are widely used in the blanket industry.

                                    - Processes of manufacturing: FDY is drawn and DTY is making texture.<br>
                                    - FDY has high strength than DTY because it is fully drawn yarn.<br>
                                    - FDY cannot stretch much as DTY. Some products donâ€™t need a stretch. FDY
                                    is more suitable than DTY.<br>
                                    - DTY is softer than FDY because it has a soft crimp texture. The texture will
                                    give a soft hand feel. It is usually produced in upholstery or skin-clinging
                                    garment.<br>
                                    - DTY has more stretch because texture also gives flexibility as it brings the
                                    produce of some items which need stretching.
