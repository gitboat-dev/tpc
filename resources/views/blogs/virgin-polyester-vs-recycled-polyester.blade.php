                                    Polyester is a man-made synthetic material that obtains from petroleum widely used in various industries, including the garment industry, interior decoration, automotive, home textile, soft toy,
                                    accessories, etc. Nowadays, polyester is one of the most used fabric types globally for the textile industry due to its advantageous characteristics such as flexibility, durability, high toughness,
                                    heat-resistance, stain-resistance, wrinkle resistance, and versatility economical price.

                                    However, global warming and pollution concerns have been the world’s attention nowadays. As virgin polyester production comes from a non-renewable source which somehow creates pollution from
                                    dyeing and solid waste, we can see that virgin production is unsustainable for the global and environment. As a leader of the polyester supplier in Thailand, Thai Polyester Co., Ltd. (TPC) aims to
                                    decrease environmental problems from our production and assures us to commit to environmentally friendly operations by focusing on recyclable, reusing, and reducing.

                                    Recycled polyester is an alternative and sustainable option to virgin polyester since the production does not depend on petroleum (non-renewable source) as a raw material. Thus, we would reduce
                                    our reliance on crude oil to continue developing on sustainable and environmentally friendly.<br>
                                    Polyester recycled yarn starts from collecting plastic bottles and production waste, then cleaning and cutting PET bottles into small pieces called PET flakes and melting flakes into pellets. The next
                                    process is melted by using high temperature and then spinning those pellets into the polyester recycled polymer.

                                    PET bottle recycling process is more sustainable and environmentally since it requires approximately 20% less energy and much less water consumption during its production cycle.
                                    Using post-consumer and post-industrial, like PET plastic bottles and other production wastes, has major benefits for decreasing the amount of plastic waste from landfills and the ocean, one of the
                                    main factors in creating and releasing toxic gases into the atmosphere. Referring to our recycled production, a jacket (450 grams) can save 18 bottles, while a blanket (60”x75”) can save up to 26 bottles
                                    of 1.5 liters water bottle. Additionally, 5,000 grams of recycled PET bottle yarn help save up to 200 bottles of 1.5 liters water bottle.<br>
                                    Polyester waste recycling reduces overall carbon dioxide emissions by about 30% compared to virgin polyester, resulting in a lower environmental impact and climate change. It also decreases the
                                    overall carbon footprint as it does not require new petroleum in its production, saving energy consumption and natural resources such as crude oil and natural gas.
                                    TPC is proud to be a polyester recycling company. In 2019, we established “ECO TPC” a brand-new ECO-friendly product line, with a variety of product ranges to support the increasing demand of
