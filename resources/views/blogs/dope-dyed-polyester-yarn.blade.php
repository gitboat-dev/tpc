                                    Have you decided what color and dyeing method to choose for your fabrics? <span class="theme-hl">Dope dyed or yarn-dyed</span>?
                                    This article will explain the differences between these two dyeing methods <span class="theme-hl">(Dope-dyed and Yarn-dyed)</span>.

                                    To begin with, <span class="theme-hl">Yarn-dyed</span> is the method of dying raw yarn before knitting or woven into the fabrics. This
                                    method has two major benefits: creating fabric in a Multi-Color Pattern and making a Garment Feel More
                                    Substantial. Additionally, the first benefit is that fabric can be created in multi-colored patterns with more
                                    complexes like jacquard. Moreover, it makes a garment feel more substantial with more body. Hence, it feels
                                    a little thicker and heavier.

                                    Wet processing is a common step in the textile industry and has significantly impacted the environment and human health. Large amounts of chemicals and dyes are used in the wet
                                    processing, which leads to larger water usage.
