										keep resources in use for as long as possible by involving the three
										Rs principle It means reducing the use of resources, reusing the
										resources that are available, and then recycling them into new
										products. Therefore, it is the system that the organizations design
										out their waste and pollution, keeping products and materials in

								Textile manufacturing is one of the largest industries in the world. It also has one of the largest carbon footprints. To
								mitigate these effects, it is important to consider what types of materials are used in textile manufacturing.

								Fabric made from polyester yarns are eco-friendly compared to other materials because it's made from recycled
								plastics that would otherwise be thrown away.
							</p>

								As a leading polyester yarn manufacturer, we have found that fabric which made from polyesters is softer and more
